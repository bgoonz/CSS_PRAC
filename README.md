#### How to add CSS to HTML

##### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

1. Inline Styles

```html
<section style="background: red">
  <h1>Get the freedom you deserve.</h1>
</section>
```

- Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element and are generally discouraged to use because they are not reusable and overrides styles declared in the <style> tag and external style sheets. They are written as a property followed by a colon and a value.
